Hello dear Time Traveling Code Masterhacker,

in this project I will try to lear handling the basics of HTML coding. The 
subject of this exercise will be a "Recipe Website". I am sure that 
everything I learned so far will aid me in making a noticable growth in my 
coding skills. So far the website The Odin Project has guided and helped 
me along this journey, alas I am confident that I will succsed in my goals 
and aspirations.

Until later cool dood. np
